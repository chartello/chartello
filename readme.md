# Chartello


[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/chartello/poc)](https://github.com/chartello/poc/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

Visualize your Laravel app data in simple dashboards.

## Installation

Add the package to your project via composer:
```bash
composer require chartello/poc
```

Publish the package resources:

```bash
php artisan chartello:install
```

Run new migrations: 

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

VoilÃ ! Open `yourapp.test/chartello` on your local machine. You should see the Chartello dashboard.

## Configuration

### Dashboard Authorization 

Chartello dashboards allow users to write SQL queries against your database. This makes it important for 
you to ensure that they are protected behind appropriate permissions.

When you install Chartello, it adds a `app\Http\Middleware\ProtectChartello` middleware to your app. This,
by default, limits the access to these dashboards only to your local environment. You should modify this 
middleware to define how access to these dashboards should be restricted in your production environment.

```php
/**
 * Define the authorization logic for accessing Chartello.
 *
 * @param $request
 * @return bool
 */
protected function authorize($request)
{
    if (App::environment('local')) {
        return true;
    }

    return $request->user() && in_array($request->user()->email, [
        //
    ]);
}
```

### Dashboard Routes

After installing Chartello, its configuration file will be located at `config/chartello.php`. This file allows you to
customize the `path` to the Chartello dashboards and adjust HTTP middleware that should be used when serving them.

## Usage

### Writing Queries

Chartello currently only supports trend charts. A trend chart expects 
an `x` column with date/datetime values and a numeric `y` column. 

To populate a trend chart, create a new panel in 
the UI and enter a query similar to this one:

```sql
SELECT DATE(created_at) AS x, COUNT(*) AS y
FROM users
WHERE created_at BETWEEN @start AND @end
GROUP BY x
ORDER BY x ASC
```

Including the `BETWEEN @start AND @end` filter ensures that your
chart reflects the date range selection available in the UI.
